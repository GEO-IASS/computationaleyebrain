There are four columns in the data: time (milliseconds), x, y, and pupil size (microns). NaN means there was a blink or other failure. The x and y positions are coded as pixel locations, but they can be converted to degrees by multiplying by 0.0348. The subject was fixating the screen center (640, 512), so you if you want a distribution near 0-mean, you could do, xdeg = (x-640) *0.0348, and ydeg =(y-512) *0.0348
