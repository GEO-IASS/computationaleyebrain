Experiments testing physically based models of the human vision, focused on the optics, retina and front end

David Brainard, Jon Winawer, Hiaomao Jiang, Brian Wandell and others initiated this repository.
It is a place to store experimental computations pertaining to optics, wavelength encoding, motion, depth,
and similar computations about the human visual system.

These scripts rely on isetbio already and they will probably rely on other tools, such as the PsychToolbox.
